# Widhya-Covid-19-Analysis-Quantitative-Modeling
Dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WidhyaOrg/datasets/master/covid19.csv Read the dataset using the 'read_csv' function in pandas. Then grouped the rows by dates to get the daily case count for Indians and foreigners respectively, recovery count, and death count. used the groupby function in pandas to achieve the above result. the 'sort' argument is used in the groupby function. Store the new data frame in a new variable. After grouping the data, the main aim is to see the daily trends in the spread of total cases. In the dataset, all the features/columns combined give the total count. then sum up each cell in a row and store the result in the data frame as a new feature. This is done using the sum function in pandas. Now visualised the data using matplotlib where the dates are plotted on X-Axis and the total cases are plotted on the Y-Axis.
